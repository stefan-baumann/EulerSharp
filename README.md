Well-documented solutions to Project Euler Problems in C#.
I was bored one day so I decided to create some well-documents solutions to problems from Project Euler to help beginners which may be interested in exemplary solutions to those problems.
For problems which allow drastic optimizations which may not be that simple to understand, I will add a separate solution with another implementation which uses those optimization opportunities.
